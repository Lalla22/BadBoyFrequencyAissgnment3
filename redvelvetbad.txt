Coming in the back back talking slick 
Tell me cuz I like that I like that
Yeah I know what to do with trouble 

Oh he don’t he don’t he don’t know
I can take em head to head go toe to toe 
Oh If you play I fight back I fight back
I’ll show you who’s in control 

Cuz I, I know how to make the devil cry 
Break em down looking in my eyes
That’s what I’m doing here tonight 

Every time I come around
Notha bad boy down
Got em like ooh ooh 
Hit em with my love like ooh ooh 
But they come back another round

Just one look from me lights out
Watch em hit the ground
Got em like ooh ooh 
Hit em with my love like ooh ooh

Running through your mind
Get you hooked, I’ll have you shedding tears 
Oh no boy this ain’t a fair fight

The more you wanna fight that 
You fight that 
The more I will pull you right back 

Cuz I, I know how to make the devil cry 
Break em down looking in my eyes
That’s what I’ll do to you tonight

Oh you’re gonna know what it feels like
To be free and open your mind
Falling in deep so hard to breathe
It’s only a matter of time

Baby I think you should know
That I ain’t like all the others 
I’m making you fall
I’m making you fall to your knees

Every time I come around 
Notha bad boy down
Got em like ooh ooh 
Hit em with my love like ooh ooh 
But they come back another round

Just one look from me lights out
Watch em hit the ground
Got em like ooh ooh 
Hit em with my love like ooh ooh 
I shot another bad boy down
