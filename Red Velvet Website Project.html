<p><a href="https://genius.com/Red-velvet-bad-boy-english-ver-bonus-track-lyrics">Lyrics</a> of the song.</p>

</p> 


<p> The song was orginally in Korean and one of Red'velvets most popular singles,
 ever since it came out in 2018. The English version was first performed at K-con and later released </p>  
<p> I choose this song because Red Velvet is one of my favorite K-pop groups and 
bad boy was one of my favorite comebacks from them. </p> 
<p> This song recieved a lot of praise worldwide and was a success, and ranked on lists as top
K-pops song of 2018. It also charted at number two on Billboard's World Digital Songs.</p>

<h1>Word Cloud</h1>

<p>To find the most fruequent words I used the data struture Hashmap.</p>
<p>I choose Hashmap because it stores value based on the key that can be used to retrive a item at a later piont. It uses
key, value for items and was perfect for getting the freuqency of song lyrics. 
<p>The code was written in java.</p>
<p>This word cloud shows the lyrics of Bad Boy by Red Velvet.</p>
<p>The most frequent words in the song are bad, shot, boy, whoa, down, and hit, which are all words in the chorus.</p>


<h1>Word Trees</h1>
<p>Word tress show a preselected word and how its is connect to the other wors in the text-based data. </p> 
<p>I used a Word Tree Generator to display the connection of the words through the most frequency lyrics.</p> 
<p>I choose this technique because its a great way to analyze data that is in the form of text. </p>

<p>Next time when I build a website what I would like to improve is being able to code data vislization myself and learning
better html code skills. I want to learn more html because it was fun building a webpage, and I want to be able to have a
data visulaization that can be intreacted with next time instead of just images, or graphs.</p>
