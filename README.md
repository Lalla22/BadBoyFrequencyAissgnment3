Song: Red Velvet - Bad Boy Lyrics English Version 

Hey
Who dat who dat who dat is (Woo)
Coming in the back back talking slick (Ah ha)
Tell me cuz I like that I like that
Yeah I know what to do with trouble (Ah ha ah ha)

Oh he don’t he don’t he don’t know
I can take em head to head go toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Oh If you play I fight back I fight back
I’ll show you who’s in control (Ooh)

Cuz I, I know how to make the devil cry (Oh right)
Break em down looking in my eyes
That’s what I’m doing here tonight (Ooh oh)

Every time I come around
Notha bad boy down
Got em like ooh ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Hit em with my love like ooh ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
But they come back another round

Just one look from me lights out
Watch em hit the ground
Got em like ooh ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Hit em with my love like ooh ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
I shot another bad boy down

Whoa whoa
I shot another bad boy down
Whoa whoa

Put you round my finger
I’mma tell you what you wanna hear
Running through your mind
Get you hooked, I’ll have you shedding tears (Uh)
Oh no boy this ain’t a fair fight
I’m winning you over alright

Oh baby my apologies (Woo)
I don’t mean to leave you hanging on a string
The more you wanna fight that (Fight that)
You fight that (Fight that)
The more I will pull you right back (Cuz I)

Cuz I, I know how to make the devil cry (Devil cry)
Break em down looking in my eyes
That’s what I’ll do to you tonight (Tonight)

Every time I come around (Every time I come around)
Notha bad boy down (Notha bad boy down)
Got em like ooh ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Hit em with my love like ooh ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
But they come back another round

Just one look from me lights out
Watch em hit the ground
Got em like ooh ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Hit em with my love like ooh ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
I shot another bad boy down

Oh you’re gonna know what it feels like
To be free and open your mind
Falling in deep so hard to breathe
It’s only a matter of time

Baby I think you should know
That I ain’t like all the others (Ain’t like others)
I’m making you fall
I’m making you fall to your knees

Every time I come around (Ooh)
Notha bad boy down
Got em like ooh ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Hit em with my love like ooh ooh (Ooh) (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
But they come back another round

Just one look from me lights out (Just one look from me)
Watch em hit the ground
Got em like ooh ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Hit em with my love like ooh ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
I shot another bad boy down
